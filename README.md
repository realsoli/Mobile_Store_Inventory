## ðŸš€ Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Setup

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realsoli/Mobile_Store_Inventory.git
   cd Mobile_Store_Inventory
   ```
 2. **Dockerize the Application**
     ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```
   This command builds the Docker images and starts the services as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Access the Application**
   Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser after the build process completes.

## Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin panel and manage products, you need to create a superuser. Follow these steps:

1. **While Docker Compose is running**, you need to open a new terminal in the same directory

2. **Create a superuser** by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

   ```
    You will be prompted to enter a username, email, and password for the superuser. Make sure the password meets Django's security requirements.
   
## Add Product
 3. **After creating the superuser,** you can access the admin interface at:
 
     ```bash
     http://localhost:8000/admin/
     ```
      OR:
    
      **after creating the superuser, go to the http://localhost:8000/**

      **There is a "Login Panel" button that you can click. Enter the username and password you created for the superuser.**

      **Once logged in, an "Add Product" button will appear on the  http://localhost:8000/, allowing you to start adding products.**
